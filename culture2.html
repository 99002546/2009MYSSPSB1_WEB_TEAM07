             <div class="text"><h2>Bharatnatyam</h2><br>Most popular in South India, Bharatanatyam is the most ancient of all the classical Indian dance forms. Originating in the temples of Tamil Nadu, today it is the most popular and widely performed of all the classical Indian dance styles. Considered to be a fire-dance, the movements of the Bharatanatyam dance resembles a dancing flame. Traditionally, this dance is a solo dance form that can be performed by male or female dancers and is characterized by different features—lasya for feminine movements and tandava for the masculine aspect. In more modern times, this dance has been performed by groups.</div>

              <div class="text"><h2>Kathakali</h2>This dance form consists of a group of dancers who portray various roles with content based on Hindu mythology. This dance form originated in southwest India in Kerala. Characterized by its dramatic makeup and elaborate costumes, audiences are taken on a visual journey in this dance form. Colors are used to describe character’s moods and status. Angry and evil characters wear red makeup, women are adorned with yellow faces, and the dancers wear large headdresses to add to the dramatic effect.
                The hands, facial expressions, and body movements embody and tell the stories in the Kathakali dance form. Traditionally, these dances would start in the evening and last through the night, but now Kathakali can be performed in three-hour presentations. </div>

               <div class="text"><h2>Kathak</h2>This dance can be traced to northern India in Uttar Pradesh and the storytellers of that time who would recite tales to music. The word Kathak means “to tell a story” and this dance form is characterized by elements that tell the story—emotional facial movement with elements of mime incorporated in the movements. The main focus is the foot movement. This dance is performed with ankle bells well-controlled by the dancer.</div>

           <div class="text"><h2>Manipuri</h2>Considered to be one of the most meaningful of the dances, the Manipuri dance originated in Northeast India. Purely a religious dance and its aim is a spiritual experience. This dance form is associated with rituals and traditional festivals. Manipuri, like Bharatanatyam, incorporates the tandava and lasya movements. This dance is smooth and fluid with no sharp, jerky movements. A dance-drama, the cymbals, and drums are usually a part of the visual performance.</div>

             <div class="text"><h2>Kuchipudi</h2>Kuchipudi was traditionally an all-male dance but is now performed by more women than men. This dance form originated in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh but is popular all over south India. The Kuchipudi dance style tells a story through fluid, graceful and brisk movements that are well-controlled and bring the piece alive. The dances are based on Hindu religion, spirituality and mythology.</div>

             <div class="text"><h2>Odissi</h2>Originating from the state of Odisha in eastern India, this dance from has its very own strong characteristic movements that clearly separates it from the other classical Indian dance forms. It is distinguished by stamping of the foot and striking sculptural poses, and the specific importance of the independent, and more contorted movement of the head, chest and pelvis (Tribhangi). Use of the hand movements (mudras) is very important in the Odissi dance, as it represents important things that help to tell the story. Themes for this dance are religious and emphasize Krishna and local themes.</div>

These include the famous small bronze male dancer. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted. After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from Daimabad.</div>
